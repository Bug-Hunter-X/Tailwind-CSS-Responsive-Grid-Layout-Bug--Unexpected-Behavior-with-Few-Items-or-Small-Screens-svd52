<div className="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    {items.map((item) => (
      <div key={item.id} className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">{item.title}</h2>

This code uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a responsive grid layout. However, it may produce unexpected results if the number of items in `items` is small and the screen size is too small for the `md:grid-cols-2` class to apply. The grid may not always behave responsively, potentially not taking the intended layout on smaller screens because `grid-cols-1` is the default, and the `md:grid-cols-2` takes effect only on screens with a minimum width of `md` breakpoint, leading to unpredicted behaviors in small-screen devices or when the number of items is less than 2, and hence, less than 2 columns.
